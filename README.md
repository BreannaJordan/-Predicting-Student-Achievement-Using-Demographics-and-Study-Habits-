## Project Title
Predicting Student Achievement Using Behavioral, Socio-Economic, and Motivational Factors

## Overview
This project analyzes the `StudentPerformanceFactors.csv` dataset (6,607 records, 20 variables) to identify the strongest predictors of student exam performance. The workflow includes:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Descriptive and inferential statistics
- Correlation analysis
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Random Forest classification
- Visualizations
- Full documentation and data dictionary

All analysis was conducted in Python using Jupyter Notebook and exported as an HTML report.
